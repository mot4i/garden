Garden is a free, thoughtfully curated sample pack designed specifically for live coding environments like Strudel, TidalCycles, and other platforms supporting .wav and .mp3 formats.
It features a rich palette of punchy drum single shots, organic textures — perfect for improvisation, and real-time coding performances.

This pack will be regularly updated with new samples to keep the sonic garden fresh and inspiring.
